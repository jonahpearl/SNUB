Systems Neuro Browser
================================



**SNUB is a visual interface for time-series data in systems neuroscience.** Using a set of linked views, users can explore relationships between raw video, animal pose, behavior annotations, and neural activity. Some example use cases are shown below below, followed by detailed

Installation
------------

Install `Anaconda <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html>`_ or `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_. Create an environment with pythonâ‰¥3.8 and pip install SNUB. 

.. code-block:: console

   conda create -n snub python=3.8
   conda activate snub
   pip install -U git+https://github.com/calebweinreb/SNUB

To test the installation, download the example data and start SNUB by running::

   snub

in a terminal or anaconda prompt (make sure the ``snub`` conda environment is activated). A browser window should launch. Go to ``File > Open Project``,  navigate to one of the example projects, and hit ``Choose`` with the project directory selected. Projects can also be opened by including the path as a command line argument::

   snub /path/to/project/directory

To use SNUB functions in jupyter, execute the following line with the ``snub`` environment active. The environment should then be listed as an option when creating a new notebook or when switching kernels (``Kernel > Change Kernel > snub``)::

   python -m ipykernel install --user --name=snub


Loading Data
------------

The ``snub.io`` module provides a set of functions for creating a new project and saving common types of data. For example, the following code creates a new project with paired electrophysiology and video data. For other data types and additional options, see the snub.io documentation. 

.. code-block:: python

   import snub.io

   project_directory = 'path/to/new/project'

   snub.io.create_project(project_directory, duration=1800)
   snub.io.add_video(project_directory, 'path/to/my_video.avi', name='IR_camera')
   snub.io.add_ephys(ephys_data) # ephys_data is a list of spike times for each unit


Another option is to create a SNUB project manually. Each project is simply a directory with data and a ``config.json`` file. The config file contains a set of global parameters and list of desired data-views, such as videos, raster plots, or scatter splots. See below for a full list of available data-views.
